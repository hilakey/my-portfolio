      <h2>About Me:</h2>   
        <p> My name is Millennia and I'm a rising junior currently attending the University of Texas at El Paso <strong>(UTEP)</strong>.<br>
        I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in Graphic Design, and this summer I'm an intern for the <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/">STEP program</a> at Google!(..virtually, but it's still neat)<br>
        Sooo, a bit about me is that I've lived in El Paso, Texas for most of my life. I have a background in art and animation.<br>Video games have been with me through it all,
        and because of them I'm interested in working in game development someday. But I want to mess around with UI/UX design as I'm interested in more creative ventures within tech.<br><br>
        Some of my <a href="myportfoliopage2.html">hobbies</a> include making art, gaming, singing classical music, and learning languages(studying Korean currently).<br>
        You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/hilakey/">GitHub</a>, where some of my projects reside &#x1F33C &#x1F33C &#x1F33C<br><br>

        As something special, here's some of my artwork!</p>

       <h2>Random Facts</h2>
       <p>So, a couple random facts about me are: </p>
       <ul>
          <li> I was in choir for 4 years</li>
          <li> My pinky on my right hand is broken-but it hasn't negatively affected anything I've done(well...I'll find out when I learn piano).</li>
          <li> I collect art prints from every art museum in the cities I travel to. My favorite one was the San Diego MOMA!</li>
          <li> Although I speak spanish, I can't roll my "R's".</li>
          <li> My first decent animation was about an alien getting pizza at a gas station(yes I have the video). In fact...I'll show you a render of a scene</li>
            <img src="images/alien.jpeg" width="300" height="200" alt="Animation Screencap">
          <li> Austin,TX and Las Vegas,NV are my favorite cities to visit.</li>
          <li> And finally...I do not like fish, in fact I'm pretty scared of them so I try to avoid them as much as possible.</li>
       </ul>
